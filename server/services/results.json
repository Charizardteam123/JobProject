And second, long-range strategic planning of IT infrastructure and operational execution. This role isn't specific to any one platform, so you'll need a good feel for all of them. And because of this, you'll experience variety and growth at Kyndryl that you won't find anywhere else.<br><br>You'll be involved early to offer solutions, help decide whether something can be done, and identify the technical and timeline risks up front. This means dealing with both client expectations and internal challenges - in other words, there are plenty of opportunities to make a difference, and a lot of people will witness your contributions. In fact, a frequent sign of success for our Infrastructure Specialists is when clients come back to us and ask for the same person by name. That's the kind of impact you can have!<br><br>This is a project-based role where you'll enjoy deep involvement throughout the lifespan of a project, as well as the chance to work closely with Architects, Technicians, and PMs. Whatever your current level of tech savvy or where you want your career to lead, you'll find the right opportunities and a buddy to support your growth.
